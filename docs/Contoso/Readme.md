## What is the Contoso Implementation?

The Contoso implementation documented within this repository provides a prescriptive first-party reference implementation for the North Star architecture guidelines. More specifically, Contoso have applied the North Star design principles to make contextualised decisions across all 8 design areas and define their target state.
