## Getting Started

This article describes how to get started with North Star reference implementation by walking you through all the prerequistes to deploy a platform-native reference implementation of North Star.
> Note:  Before you start, make sure that you have read and understood the overall design objective and scope of the reference implementation.

## Target audience
The target audience for this guide is people with a typical DevOps / SRE background and assumes knowledge in Azure Resource Manager (ARM)/Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Git, and PowerShell.

## Contents
This article is divided in two sections:
 - The first part will cover the [prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md) needed to use the North Star reference implementation and it will also describe how to [sync your fork with upstream repo](./Prerequisites.md/#Sync-your-fork-with-upstream-repo), to ensure your GitHub fork is kept updated with changes being released in the upstream NorthStar GitHub [repo](https://github.com/Azure/CET-NorthStar).
 - The second part of this article will describe how to test and [validate prerequisites](./Validate-prereqs.md) by deploying ARM templates at the tenant root scope. Please note that this step is optional.
